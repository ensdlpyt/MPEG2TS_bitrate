# MPEG2TS_bitrate
Given a valid MPEG-2 TS file (.ts) calculate the constant bitrate from PCR timestamps

Its surprising how difficult it is to get a tool to calculate the constant bitrate (cbr) from a MPEG-2 transport stream file.

This was a quick script I put together during my time at International Datacasting Corporation to perform the marginally trivial task of obtaining a CBR.
